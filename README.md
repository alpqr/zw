Play with Zig and D3D12. Take zmath/zmesh/zstbi/zwin32 + some inspiration from zd3d12 and the examples from https://github.com/michal-z/zig-gamedev, and do something.
(something being some basic engine bits, rendering some objects, loading up Sponza.gltf and rendering it (just base color), rendering Dear ImGui content on top, etc.)
